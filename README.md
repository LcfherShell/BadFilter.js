## 🎉 **Welcome to BadFilter.js!** 🎉

Tired of offensive language in your app? 🚫 **BadFilter.js** to the rescue! We’ve crafted a supercharged, customizable solution that helps developers filter out inappropriate words like a pro. Let's make the internet a friendlier place one word at a time! 🌐💬

---

## 🛠️ **Overview**

**BadFilter.js** offers two powerful components:
- **FilterBadWord Class**: The brains of the operation! This utility class is responsible for filtering unwanted words from your text.
- **filters_badword Function**: A lightweight wrapper around `FilterBadWord` for easier, more streamlined usage. Think of it as the "express mode" for your text-filtering needs!

With these components, you can easily cleanse your text, ensuring a respectful, safe online environment. 🚀✨

## 🔧 **How It Works**
Both **FilterBadWord** and **filters_badword** combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) for *accurate* and *intelligent* word filtering.

Here's the breakdown of the magic:
1. **Tokenization**: Your text gets split into individual words (tokens) 🧩.
2. **NLP Analysis**: The tokens are scanned using cutting-edge NLP algorithms to sniff out those pesky bad words 🕵️‍♂️.
3. **Machine Learning**: Filtering gets smarter with each interaction, ensuring those inappropriate words vanish into thin air ✨.
4. **Customization**: Want to fine-tune the filter to match your app's personality? You got it! Use the handy config method to tweak things to perfection 🎛️.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### 1️⃣ **HTML Setup**
Want to use BadFilter.js in your web app? No problem! Here’s how:
```html
<!-- Add badword.js into the HTML page -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="./badword.js"></script>
<!-- Or import directly if supporting ES Module -->
<script type="module" src="./badword.js">
</script> 

<script>
const badfilter = new FilterBadWord("FUck master");
console.log(badfilter.clean(badfilter.position())); // Output: ***** master
</script>
```
Easy peasy, right? 🍋

### 2️⃣ **Node.js Setup**
If you’re working on a Node.js project, just use this:
```javascript
const { FilterBadWord, filters_badword } = require('./badword.js');

// Express filtering using filters_badword
const badfilter = new FilterBadWord("FUck master");
console.log(badfilter.clean(badfilter.position())); // Output: ***** master
```

### 🎯 **Pro Mode: filters_badword Class**
For full control over filtering, dive into the **filters_badword** class:
```javascript
const badfilt = new filters_badword();
badfilt.config(true, false); // Custom filtering settings
badfilt.text_o("FUck master"); // Censored output: ***** master
console.log(badfilt.cleans);
console.log(badfilt.position()); // Shows position of the bad word

badfilt.text_o("motherfucker");
console.log(badfilt.cleans); // Output: *************
console.log(badfilt.position());
```

🔧 **Config it your way!** Customize how strict or lenient your filter should be using `.config()`. Want more control? You got it!
